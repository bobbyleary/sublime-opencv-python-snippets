## Sublime Text 2: OpenCV (2.4.5) Python Snippets

_Work in Progress_

Not all functions are in this package. Please email me, submit an issue or a pull request for fixes or additions.

This package utilizes Sublime Text 2's fuzzy searching, so there are no snippet shortcodes. Just start typing letters within the function name.

OpenCV function information can be found here --> [http://docs.opencv.org/index.html](http://docs.opencv.org/index.html)

Enjoy!
